# Hi, I'm Pietro 👋

I'm a robotics PhD student focusing on **model-based planning and control of linear and nonlinear switched systems**.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- **Model-based control** of linear and nonlinear switched systems  
- **Optimal switching sequence design**  
- **Numerical optimization for control**  
- **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**  
- Integration of **model-based guarantees** with **data-driven methods**

---

## 🚀 Current Research

During my PhD, I have been exploring different ways to **jointly optimize the switching sequence and the control input** of a switched system:

- ✔️ **Direct optimization** of subsystem time durations + classical control inputs  
- ✔️ **Smoothing-based reformulation** of switching conditions into a single dynamical system  
- ✔️ **Application to quadrupedal locomotion**, where robust planning and control are essential  

I also developed a **numerical optimization procedure** to solve **continuous-time optimal control problems** with linear switched systems, **optimizing both control inputs and subsystem durations simultaneously**.

Lately, I've been exploring the integration of **neural networks** and **learning-based methods** to further enhance switched-system controllers while preserving formal guarantees.

My work aligns closely with the research directions of the **SYSCOP Lab**, especially in the context of model-based control with tailored numerical methods.
