# Pietro Gori
Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Pietro, a robotics PhD student working on **model-based planning and control of linear and nonlinear switched systems**.  

I also have a strong interest in robotics and numerical optimization, and I’m excited about bringing together classical control theory with smart, data-driven solutions.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on robotics-related projects, and experimenting with optimization and simulation tools.  
Feel free to explore my repositories — and don’t hesitate to reach out!
