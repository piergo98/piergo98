# Pietro Gori
Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Pietro, a robotics PhD student working on **model-based planning and control of linear and nonlinear switched systems**.  

I also have a strong interest in robotics and numerical optimization, and I’m excited about bringing together classical control theory with smart, data-driven solutions.

In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on robotics-related projects, and experimenting with optimization and simulation tools.  
Feel free to explore my repositories — and don’t hesitate to reach out!

## 🚀 Notable Projects

Although my work spans several areas in control, optimization, and robotics, a project I consider especially meaningful is:

### **OCSLC**
A numerical optimization framework to solve **continuous-time optimal control problems** with **linear switched systems** by jointly optimizing:
- the **control input**, and  
- the **time duration of each subsystem**  

This approach leverages **direct optimal control techniques**, CasADi, and nonlinear programming solvers, and has been tested on challenging robotic applications such as **quadrupedal locomotion** — where solid planning and control foundations are essential.
